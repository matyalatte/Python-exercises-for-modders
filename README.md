## About
Python exercises for modders.<br>
If you want to mod binary data in games with Python, you need to be able to solve these exercises.

## Why Python?
There are better languages for binary editing.<br>
But Python is one of the easiest languages.<br>
So, I think it is the best language for beginner modders.<br>
Also, if you learn Python, you will be able to make Blender scripts!<br>

## Notes
- Finish a Python tutorial somewhere before solving them. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tutorial) has a good tutorial.
- Use Python3.x. (There are 2 kinds of Python. 2.x and 3.x.)

## How to Use
Each folder has an exercise.<br>
Open `exercise.py` with editor and read comments.<br>
The solution is written in `solution.py`.
